1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes gives more control to pull only the branches in need than all that is being setup remote. 

2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - happens within a github repository. equivalent to cloning within github repo.
clones - happens on a local repo or between a local and github repo
branches - easy way to create an experimental task or label. Happens both from & to github. The push and pull happens through branches often.

3. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The sheer benefit is the mangagement of local versions of the repository such that only the final changes once tested for completeness can be pushed to the remote. All the local stuffs can happen offline except the push to the server.

4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without a tool like Git and Github it would be hard to collaborate. Even if collaboration is carried out by some means, it is difficult to share the changes expect the sanctity of the changes to be maintained across collaborators.

5. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I would consider for a new branch to make changes when it has to be reviewed by other collaborators before making it in the master copy.
