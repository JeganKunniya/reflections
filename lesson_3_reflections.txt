1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes gives more control to pull only the branches in need than all that is being setup remote. 

2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - happens within a github repository. equivalent to cloning within github repo.
clones - happens on a local repo or between a local and github repo
branches - easy way to create an experimental task or label. Happens both from & to github. The push and pull happens through branches often.
